    Average misalignment (in seconds) predicted by [Synchformer](https://github.com/v-iashin/Synchformer) with the `24-01-04T16-39-21` model trained on AudioSet. We average the results from the first 4.8 seconds and last 4.8 seconds of each video-audio pair.

## Installation

This repository has been tested on Ubuntu, and requires **Python 3.9+** with **PyTorch 2.5.1+**. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

### 1. Recommended Setup

We recommend using a [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) environment.

### 2. Install PyTorch

Before proceeding, install PyTorch with the appropriate CUDA version from the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

### 3. Clone and Install the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkchengrex/av-benchmark.git
cd av-benchmark
pip install -e .
```

### 4. Download Pretrained Models

Download [music_speech_audioset_epoch_15_esc_89.98.pt](https://huggingface.co/lukewys/laion_clap/resolve/main/music_speech_audioset_epoch_15_esc_89.98.pt) and [Synchformer](https://github.com/hkchengrex/MMAudio/releases/download/v0.1/synchformer_state_dict.pth) and put them in `weights`.

(Alternatively, execute the following when you are in the root directory of this repository)

```bash
mkdir weights
wget https://huggingface.co/lukewys/laion_clap/resolve/main/music_speech_audioset_epoch_15_esc_89.98.pt -O weights/music_speech_audioset_epoch_15_esc_89.98.pt
wget https://github.com/hkchengrex/MMAudio/releases/download/v0.1/synchformer_state_dict.pth -O weights/synchformer_state_dict.pth
```

### 5. Optional: For Video Evaluation

If you plan to evaluate on videos, you will also need `ffmpeg`. 
For video decoding, `torio` is the default backend because it is the best option for backward compatibility with the existing results.
If you use `torch>=2.9`, we automatically switch to the `pyav` backend, and the torchaudio `ffmpeg<7` version limit does not apply in that case.
On a small-scale test, we observed matching outputs between `torio` and `pyav`, but we do not guarantee identical results in all environments or datasets.
You can install it as follows:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge 'ffmpeg<7'
```

## Usage

### Overview

Evaluation is a two-stage process:

1. **Extraction**: extract video/text/audio features for ground-truth and audio features for the predicted audios. The extracted features are saved in `gt_cache` and `pred_cache` respectively.
2. **Evaluation**: compute the desired metrics using the extracted features.

By default, if `gt_cache` or `pred_cache` are not specified, we will use `gt_audio/cache` and `pred_audio/cache`.
`gt_audio` and `pred_audio` should point to a directory containing audio files in either `.wav` or `.flac` formats.

### Extraction

#### 1. **Video feature extraction (optional).**
For video-to-audio applications, visual features are extracted from input videos. This is also applicable for generated videos in audio-to-video or audio-visual joint generation tasks.

**Input requirements:**

- Videos in .mp4 format (any FPS or resolution).
- Video names must match the corresponding audio file names (excluding extensions).

Run the following to extract visual features using `Synchformer` and `ImageBind`:

```bash
python extract_video.py --gt_cache <output cache directory> --video_path <directory containing videos> --gt_batch_size <batch size> --audio_length=<length of video in seconds>
```

Some of the precomputed caches for VGGSound/AudioCaps can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/hkchengrex/MMAudio-precomputed-results

#### 2. **Text feature extraction (optional).**
For text-to-audio applications, text features are extracted from input text data.

**Input requirements:**

- A CSV file with at least two columns with a header row:
    - `name`: Matches the corresponding audio file name (excluding extensions).
    - `caption`: The text associated with the audio.

Run the following to extract text features using `LAION-CLAP` and `MS-CLAP`:

```bash
python extract_text.py --text_csv <path to the csv> --output_cache_path <output cache directory>
```

#### 3. **Audio feature extraction.**

Audio features are automatically extracted during the evaluation stage.

**Manual extraction:**
You can force feature extraction by specifying:
 - `--recompute_gt_cache` for ground-truth audio features.
 - `--recompute_pred_cache` for predicted audio features.

This is useful if the extraction is interrupted or the cache is corrupted.

### Evaluation

```bash
python evaluate.py  --gt_audio <gt audio path> --gt_cache <gt cache path> --pred_audio <pred audio path> --pred_cache <pred cache path> --audio_length=<length of audio wanted in seconds> 
```

You can specify `--skip_clap` or `--skip_video_related` to speed up evaluation if you don't need those metrics.
